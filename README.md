# PoliceLocationDatabase
This is an experimental tool to collect location data of United States police officers to ensure accountability to the US population. 

# Why?
The goal is to just collect reports of police activity via individual users similar to Google Maps and Waze's speed trap reporting. Currently there is no third party sources for police location data. This data set is will not contain any identifying data on specific officers and is supposed to be used in agregate to show policing patters not to out specific officers.
